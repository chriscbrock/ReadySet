# ReadySet

Ready set is a launcher for Windows that will allow you to launch any application that is in your path, open a document in its default application or run a [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/powershell) command.

## Usage

Once ReadySet is running you can use the following key combination to bring up the launcher `Shift+Win+C`. When the launcher is active you can use `Shift+Ctrl+P` to switch to running a PowerShell command and `Shift+Ctrl+C` to switch back to the generic command runner.

## Prerequisites

To run ReadySet you will need the Microsoft .NET framework 4.5 installed, if you don't have it you can download it from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

## Future Plans

* Build in the ability to start the application when the user logs in.
* Give the user the ability to set their preferred default runner.
* Move to plugin based architecture to make it easier to add new command runners.
* Add auto-completion.
* Add a command history on a per-runner basis.
* Ability to customise the global hot key.

## 3rd Party

ReadySet uses some 3rd party libraries to achieve its functionality:

* [WPF NotifyIcon](http://www.hardcodet.net/projects/wpf-notifyicon)

The runner in the icon was retrieved from [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/noun/running/#icon-No246) and is published under a Public Domain Mark.
